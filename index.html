## Dearest projects

All of the work in [medula.cl](http://medula.cl) has been done under my lead; most, directly by me. I
have created several long relationships with customers and organizations which enable constant iteration of
projects even on tight budgets. Some of the most notable are:

### Flyimg: Image transformations microservice

#### (2017) {#section .the-year}

[https://github.com/flyimg/flyimg](https://github.com/flyimg/flyimg/)

Dockerized PHP7 application runs as a Microservice to resize and crop images on the fly. Get optimised images
with MozJPEG, WebP or PNG using ImageMagick.

Performance and image compression have been my pet peeves for years, this year I joined a friend to develop this
microservice that generates images ready to be used in responsive projects.

I wrote the resizing and cropping algorithms, most of the documentation and the nginx config.

---

### Westwing Redesign

#### (2015) {#section-1 .the-year}

[www.westwing.de](https://www.westwing.de/), [www.westwingnow.de](https://www.westwingnow.de/)

Coded most of the redesign of the two most visited pages at Westwing.de.

Recently coded most of the redesign and refactor of the whole product grid in it's multiple incarnations.

Monitoring and pushing the frontend performance of the Westwing website, looking to get the highest impact with
the lowest effort possible.

---

### _La Guía Silvestre_ / The Sylvan Guide : biodiversity and wild areas app.

#### (2014) {#section-2 .the-year}

[huilmo.org](http://baamenabar.github.io/sitio-guia-silvestre/)

My baby, a project in the making. A compiler of biodiversity guides, each aimed at specific locations, with
geolocation and local storage of information. It currently can load, process and import Missions from [Project
Noah](http://www.projectnoah.org/) and compile them in a Ionic web-app.

Initially started with Sencha Touch 2, but switched to Ionic + AngularJS + NodeJS and fell in love with them.

I applied the project for seed funding, but on september 2014 got rejected for not having enough potential
profit.

Note: the huilmo.org website was hacked together from a lousy template in one night, not my code.

The repo can be found at: <https://github.com/baamenabar/vas>

### Paz Vial: e-commerce

#### (2010 – 2014) {#section-4 .the-year}

[pazvial.cl](http://pazvial.cl/)

A long project that turned a Flash image gallery into a full fledged responsive on-line store. Custom code, front
to back. Built as budget became available with frequent revisiting of each module. Designed the UI for the back-end
and coded the whole site. Co-designed the client side defining visitor goals and tasks.

In 2014’s iterations attention was put on redesigning and building a mobile-first, responsive site, **optimized
for speed**. It was the first time doing a **front-end style guide** before the actual site,
it deeply informed the design process ad helped a lot with the rebuild [estilos.pazvial.cl](http://estilos.pazvial.cl)
.

In 2012 coded the full front and back-end, integrating a modified version of my **[jQuery
File Upload and Crop](https://github.com/baamenabar/jQuery-File-Upload-and-Crop)** project.

---

### VIK Winery e-commerce & promotional site

#### (2010 – 2014) {#section-5 .the-year}

[vik.cl](http://www.vik.cl/) & [secure.vik.cl](http://secure.vik.cl/)

2014 we rebuild the wine store, mobile first and optimized for speed, plus several new modules for the store
functionality.

2011 I did a complete rebuild of a Flash Site retaining most of the look and “responsive” layout, but
coding with mobile-first responsive site. Including an adaptive images script which uses Javascript and PHP
to load the adequate size images. The site was tested to work from IE7 to Blackberry 5, including common Android
and iOS devices and browsers.

---

### Aramark Chile Services offline mobile web-app

#### (2013) {#section-6 .the-year}

[Aramark services](http://medula.cl/temp/am/)

The iPad version of an interactive presentation we did earlier that year for presenting Aramark’s services
for the mining industries at Expo Nor (mining exposition).

Lead the team of 6 who developed the web app on short notice, from project management to the illustration team.
Did the animation, some colouring and the coding.

It’s a website developed to fully work off-line as an app launched from the home screen, aimed at the iPad,
but also works perfectly on mobile phones.

---

### Driver: mobile app + WordPress

#### (2012) {#section-7 .the-year}

[driver.cl](http://www.driver.cl/)

I conceived and completely developed the **WDIT Android app**. It was developed with
Sencha Touch 2 and Cordova to be deployed as a proof of concept for improving security standards in a mine.

The application allows users to select the activities assigned to them and check every task or sub step which can
be also verified by a picture that gets uploaded through the local server to AWS for
storage an late analysis.

You can view some wireframes.

-   **admin panel wireframes** [PDF](/files/admin-web-dg.pdf) |
    [SVG 1](/files/admin-p1.svg), [SVG
    2](/files/admin-p2.svg)
-   **mobile app wireframes** [PDF](/files/mobile-dg.pdf) | [SVG 1](/files/mobile-app-p1.svg), [SVG 2](/files/mobile-app-p2.svg), [SVG 3](/files/mobile-app-p3.svg)

The app has an admin back-end to generate and control activities, tasks, users and permissions.

Developed also a whole suite of web software. From a WordPress site, an internal document publishing web app, to
a custom android app.

Some of this process I documented in [my blog](http://code.medula.cl/).

### JZMusic: event production + clients accounts

#### (2012 – 2013) {#section-8 .the-year}

[jzmusic.cl](http://jzmusic.cl/stage/)

My earliest client, since our first conversation 10 years ago, he has had creative ideas about his site, together
we have built many tools his clients love.

This latest version is a full responsive, mobile first website. Custom JavaScript throughout the site. Drupal
private site for the clients’ events, with a playlist generator. (ask me for access to a demo account)

---

### Other e-commerce

I have done several more e-commerce and e-commerce-like sites, some of the ones that remain online are:

-   [Hot Tub Repair and Service LLC](http://htrsllc.com/)
-   <http://catalinaamenabar.cl/appp/> This is a mobile sales app I
    did in a weekend for a pastry shop ([The website too](http://catalinaamenabar.cl/)).
-   e-commerce for a now closed Video games shop: <http://goodgame.cl/> (archive)
