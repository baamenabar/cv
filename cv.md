## Summary

Graphic Designer by profession, web developer by choice. 

Working the web as a generalist, focusing on the problems that need solving, always trying to integrate new technologies or new approaches into projects. Huge fan of the 80/20 principle, specially when time is scarce.

A veteran ActionScript orphan, now in love with front–end technologies, semantics and progressive enhancement. Down to earth seasoned project manager. 

Doing the most varied client work since 2004, always elbow to elbow with designers. From UX to server–side optimization, a wide view of problems usually let's me find solutions where they are most effective.
