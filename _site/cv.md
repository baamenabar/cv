## Summary

Professional designer developer, constantly working at the edge of technology to bring solutions to his clients needs... Well, even though it's `true`ish , I hate that way of writing.

Graphic Designer by profession, web developer by choice. 

Embracing the web in many of it forms, a means to a client's end, having fun in the meanwhile. 

A veteran ActionScript orphan, now in love with semantics and progressive enhancement. Down to earth seasoned project manager.

## Manic about
