h2. Summary

Graphic Designer by profession, web developer by choice, self employed most of my career. 

Mediating between clients, designers and their users, facilitating their interaction and goals through web technologies. Working on the web mostly passionately as a front-end developer, always trying to integrate new technologies or new approaches into projects. Huge fan of the 80/20 principle, especially when time is scarce.

Giving wings to designers' creativity, providing them with options and ideas has been my work for more than 8 years. Doing responsive design before the term was even coined (since the era of full Flash sites). A veteran ActionScript orphan, now in love with front–end technologies, semantics and progressive enhancement. Particularly re-enchanted by Javascript in the recent years.

Doing the most varied client work since 2004, always elbow to elbow with designers. From UX to server–side optimization, a wide view of problems usually lets me find solutions where they are most effective.

h2. Dearest projects

All of the work in "medula.cl":http://medula.cl has been done under my lead; most, directly by me. I have created several long relationships with customers and organizations which enable constant iteration of projects even on tight budgets. Some of the most notable are:

h3. __[es]La Guía Silvestre__ / The Sylvan Guide : biodiversity and wild areas app.

h4(the-year). (2014)

"huilmo.org":http://huilmo.org/

My baby, a project in the making. A compiler of biodiversity guides, each aimed at specific locations, with geolocation and local storage of information. It currently can load, process and import Missions from "Project Noah":http://www.projectnoah.org/ and compile them in a Ionic web-app.

Initially started with Sencha Touch 2, but switched to Ionic + AngularJS + NodeJS and fell in love with them.

I applied the project for seed funding, but on september 2014 got rejected for not having enough potential profit.

<small>Note: the huilmo.org website was hacked together from a lousy template in one night, not my code.</small>

The repo can be found at: "https://github.com/baamenabar/vas":https://github.com/baamenabar/vas

h3. DMJ Analytics

h4(the-year). (2014)

"dmjanalytics.com":http://dmjanalytics.com/

A deep exploration of authoring and managing SVG assets with modern tools like Gulp.

The SVG animation and CSS animations of SVG where also hand coded.

The site is small and optimized for mobile, responsibly responsive, mobile first.

<hr>

h3. Paz Vial: e-commerce 

h4(the-year). (2010 - 2014)

"pazvial.cl":http://pazvial.cl/

A long project that turned a Flash image gallery into a full fledged responsive on-line store. Custom code, front to back. Built as budget became available with frequent revisiting of each module. Designed the UI for the back-end and coded the whole site. Co-designed the client side defining visitor goals and tasks. 

In 2012 coded the full front and back-end, integrating a modified version of my **"jQuery File Upload and Crop":https://github.com/baamenabar/jQuery-File-Upload-and-Crop** project.

In 2014's iterations attention was put on building a mobile-first responsive redesign and code, optimized for speed.

<hr>

h3(break-page-before). VIK Winery e-commerce & promotional site 

h4(the-year). (2010 - 2014)

"vik.cl":http://www.vik.cl/ & "secure.vik.cl":http://secure.vik.cl/

2014 we rebuild the wine store, mobile first and optimized for speed, plus several new modules for the store functionality.

2011 I did a complete rebuild of a Flash Site retaining most of the look and "responsive" layout, but coding with mobile-first responsive site. Including an adaptive images script which uses Javascript and PHP to load the adequate size images. The site was tested to work from IE7 to Blackberry 5, including common Android and iOS devices and browsers.

<hr>

h3. Aramark Chile Services offline mobile web-app

h4(the-year). (2013)

"Aramark services":http://medula.cl/temp/am/

The iPad version of an interactive presentation we did earlier that year for presenting Aramark's services for the mining industries at Expo Nor (mining exposition).

Lead the team of 6 who developed the web app on short notice, from project management to the illustration team. Did the animation, some colouring and the coding.

It's a website developed to fully work off-line as an app launched from the home screen, aimed at the iPad, but also works perfectly on mobile phones.

<hr>

h3. Driver: mobile app + WordPress 

h4(the-year). (2012)

"driver.cl":http://www.driver.cl/

I conceived and completely developed the **WDIT Android app**. It was developed with Sencha Touch 2 and Cordova to be deployed as a proof of concept for improving security standards in a mine. 

The application allows users to select the activities assigned to them and check every task or sub step which can be also verified by a picture that gets uploaded through the local server to AWS for storage an late analysis.

You can view some wireframes. 
* *admin panel wireframes* "PDF":{{ site.url }}/files/admin-web-dg.pdf | "SVG 1":{{ site.url }}/files/admin-p1.svg, "SVG 2":{{ site.url }}/files/admin-p2.svg
* *mobile app wireframes* "PDF":{{ site.url }}/files/mobile-dg.pdf | "SVG 1":{{ site.url }}/files/mobile-app-p1.svg, "SVG 2":{{ site.url }}/files/mobile-app-p2.svg, "SVG 3":{{ site.url }}/files/mobile-app-p3.svg

The app has an admin back-end to generate and control activities, tasks, users and permissions.

Developed also a whole suite of web software. From a WordPress site, an internal document publishing web app, to a custom android app.

Some of this process I documented in "my blog":http://code.medula.cl/.

h3. JZMusic: event production + clients accounts 

h4(the-year). (2012 - 2013)

"jzmusic.cl":http://jzmusic.cl/stage/

My earliest client, since our first conversation 10 years ago, he has had creative ideas about his site, together we have built many tools his clients love.

This latest version is a full responsive, mobile first website. Custom JavaScript throughout the site. Drupal private site for the clients' events, with a playlist generator. (ask me for access to a demo account)

<hr>

h3. Other e-commerce

I have done several more e-commerce and e-commerce-like sites, some of the ones that remain online are:

* "Hot Tub Repair and Service LLC":http://htrsllc.com/
* "http://catalinaamenabar.cl/appp/":http://catalinaamenabar.cl/appp/ This is a mobile sales app I did in a weekend for a pastry shop ("The website too":http://catalinaamenabar.cl/).
* e-commerce for a now closed Video games shop: "http://goodgame.cl/":http://goodgame.cl/ (archive)
