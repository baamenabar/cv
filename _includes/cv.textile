h2. Summary

Graphic Designer by profession, web developer by choice, self employed most of my career. 

Mediating between my clients and their users, facilitating their interaction and goals trough web technologies. Working the web as a generalist, always trying to integrate new technologies or new approaches into projects. Huge fan of the 80/20 principle, specially when time is scarce.

User eXperience is the new term for what has driven my work for more than 8 years. Doing responsive design since the era of full Flash sites. Down to earth seasoned project manager. A veteran ActionScript orphan, now in love with front–end technologies, semantics and progressive enhancement. Expert in developing custom code to perfectly fit the problems of my clients.

Doing the most varied client work since 2004, always elbow to elbow with designers. From UX to server–side optimization, a wide view of problems usually lets me find solutions where they are most effective.

h3. JZMusic: event production + clients accounts 

h4(the-year). (2012 - 2013)

"jzmusic.cl":http://jzmusic.cl/stage/

The My earliest client, since our first conversation 9 years ago, he has had creative ideas about his site, Togeder we have built many tools clients love. 

This version is a full responsive, mobile first website. Custom Javascript throughout the site. Drupal private site for the clients events, with a playlist generator. (ask me for a user and password)

h3(break-page-before). Paz Vial: e-commerce 

h4(the-year). (2010 - 2013)

"pazvial.cl":http://pazvial.cl/

A long project that turned a Flash image gallery into a full fledged online store. Custom code, front to back. I designed the UI for te backend and coded the whole site. Co-designed the client side defining visitor goals and tasks, coded the full front and back end and integrated a modified version of my **"jQuery File Upload and Crop":https://github.com/baamenabar/jQuery-File-Upload-and-Crop** project.

You can visit the admin panel of a clone at: "http://m0.cl/pazvial.cl/extranet/":http://m0.cl/pazvial.cl/extranet/ (ask me for a user and password)

h3. Assa Abloy Chile: e-commerce 

h4(the-year). (2011 - 2013)

"assaabloy.cl":http://www.assaabloy.cl

A long project where I did the information architecture based on the printed catalogs they had. Then designed the data structure of the CMS and the user flow. For the final stage I assembled and directed a team of remote developers.

While one showed me the magic of doing CSS with compass/sass, the other marveled me with the MVC framework CodeIgniter.

Again I integrated a modified version of my **"jQuery File Upload and Crop":https://github.com/baamenabar/jQuery-File-Upload-and-Crop** project, for the administration of banners, it was a great success with the admins of the site.

Adittionaly we developed a whole suite of video tutorials to be displayed on the dashboard of the Admin panel which explain the use of the different parts of the site administration process. Since then we deliver every site with a video tutorial suite.

In May 2013 addapted the "Simplecart-JS":https://github.com/wojodesign/simplecart-js library to make a quotation cart for the site. It works completely in the front end, using localstorage and cookies to manage the “session”, and sends a predefined quotation for the sales team to fill and return to the customer.

h3(break-page-before). Driver: mobile app + WordPress 

h4(the-year). (2012)

"driver.cl":http://www.driver.cl/

I conceived and completely developed the **WDIT Andoid app**. It was developed with Sencha Touch 2 and Cordova as a proof of concept. 

The application allows users to select the activities assigned to them and check every task or sub step which can be also verified by a picture that gets uploaded to the server when connection is available.

You can view some wireframes. 
* *admin panel wireframes* "PDF":{{ site.url }}/files/admin-web-dg.pdf | "SVG 1":{{ site.url }}/files/admin-p1.svg, "SVG 2":{{ site.url }}/files/admin-p2.svg
* *mobile app wireframes* "PDF":{{ site.url }}/files/mobile-dg.pdf | "SVG 1":{{ site.url }}/files/mobile-app-p1.svg, "SVG 2":{{ site.url }}/files/mobile-app-p2.svg, "SVG 3":{{ site.url }}/files/mobile-app-p3.svg

The app has an admin back-end to generate and control activities, tasks, users and permissions.

I developed also a whole suite of web software. From a Wordpress site, an internal document publishing web app. To a custom android app.

Some of this process I documented in "my blog":http://code.medula.cl/.

h3. VIK Winery e-commerce & promotional site 

h4(the-year). (2011)

"vik.cl":http://www.vik.cl/ & "store.vik.cl":http://store.vik.cl/

Including an adaptive images script which uses Javascript and PHP to load the adequate size images. The site tas tested to work from IE7 to Blackberry 5, including common Android and iOS devices and browsers.

h3(break-page-before). Nescappuccino Game (Nestle) 

h4(the-year). (2011)

Assembled and directed a small team to develop a Game for the sales forces of Nestlé Pro, in Chile. Also did the script, design, art direction, project direction and lead development of the game, also some illustration.

Here I learned the immense amount of work involved in game development, and learned about many runtime optimization techniques and testing techniques.
