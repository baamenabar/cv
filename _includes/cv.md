## Summary

Graphic Designer by profession, web developer by choice, self employed most of my career. 

Working the web as a generalist, focusing on the problems that need solving, always trying to integrate new technologies or new approaches into projects. Huge fan of the 80/20 principle, specially when time is scarce.

A veteran ActionScript orphan, now in love with front–end technologies, semantics and progressive enhancement. Doing responsive design since the era of full Flash sites. Down to earth seasoned project manager. Expert in developing custom code to perfectly fit the problems of my clients.

Doing the most varied client work since 2004, always elbow to elbow with designers. From UX to server–side optimization, a wide view of problems usually lets me find solutions where they are most effective.

## Dearest client's projects

### JZMusic (2012 - 2013) _in Beta_

[jzmusic.cl](http://jzmusic.cl/stage/)

The My earliest client, since our first conversation 9 years ago, he has had creative ideas about his site, I have just give them wings. 

This version is a full responsive, mobile first website. SVGfall and picturefill helping with the images. Custom Javascript throughout the site. Drupal site for the clients events.

----

### Paz Vial (2010 - 2013)

[pazvial.cl](http://pazvial.cl/)

A long project that turned a Flash image gallery into a full fledged online store. Custom code, front to back. I co-designed the site, coded the full front and back end and integrated a modified version of my **[jQuery File Upload and Crop](https://github.com/baamenabar/jQuery-File-Upload-and-Crop)** project.

----

### Assa Abloy Chile (2011 - 2013)

[assaabloy.cl](http://www.assaabloy.cl)

A long project where I did the information architecture based on the printed catalogs they had. Then designed the data structure of the CMS and the user flow. For the final stage I assembled and directed a team of remote developers.

While one showed me the magic of doing CSS with compass/sass, the other marveled me with the MVC framework CodeIgniter.

Again I integrated a modified version of my **[jQuery File Upload and Crop](https://github.com/baamenabar/jQuery-File-Upload-and-Crop)** project, for the administration of banners, it was a great success with the admins of the site.

In May 2013 addapted the [Simplecart-JS](https://github.com/wojodesign/simplecart-js) library to make a quotation cart for the site. It works completely in the front end, using localstorage and cookies to manage the “session”.

----

### Driver (2012)

[driver.cl](http://www.driver.cl/)

I conceived and completely developed the **WDIT Andoid app**. It was developed with Sencha Touch 2 and Cordova as a proof of concept. 

The application allows users to select the activities assigned to them and check every task or sub step which can be also verified by a picture that gets uploaded to the server when connection is available.

The app has an admin back-end to generate and control activities, tasks, users and permissions.

I developed also a whole suite of web software. From a Wordpress site, an internal document publishing web app. To a custom android app.

Some of this process I documented in [my blog](http://code.medula.cl/).

----

### VIK Winery (2011)

[vik.cl](http://www.vik.cl/)

Complete rebuild of a Flash Site retaining most of the look and layout, but coding with mobile-first responsive site. Including an adaptive images script which uses Javascript and PHP to load the adequate size images. The site tas tested to work from IE7 to Blackberry 5, including common Android and iOS devices and browsers.

----

### Nescappuccino Game (Nestle) (2011)

Script, design, art direction, project direction and development of a Game for the sales forces of Nestlé Pro, in Chile. 

Here I learned the immense amount of work involved in game development, and learned about many runtime optimization techniques and testing techniques.

----

### Older stuff

There's older stuff, but it's mostly Flash / ActionScript, even though there's some cool things, like a [realtime rendering 3D experimental site](http://medula.cl/as-p/main.php) (must click PORTAFOLIO -> 2010).
