Dear Disqus Team

UI Engineer position.

Today, when reviewing the new “Update to Disqus Privacy Policy”, out of curiosity I checked the jobs you have listed and the UI Engineer caught my eye. When I read the description I got the impression that it summed the part that I most like about my job, and would love to do it for years, specially in a growing company that has to keep up to date. 

So I've spent the rest of the day updating a bit my stagnant CV.

(By the way loved the new Notifications overlay that slides in).

I strongly believe that I can bring a set of skills, enthusiasm, commitment and experience to your team. I am Designer by academic training but a self taught developer with 10 years of working experience in a variety of front-end languages and technologies, particularly good at HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

I am a self driven professional who has been at the service of multiple clients for the last eight years, some for several years. I deeply enjoy complex problems and even more as part of a team with whom to work on them. I am keen on understanding deeply each technology I have to work with.

Much more details about me and examples of my work can be found on my on-line CV at http://iminabar.com (That's how my last name is pronounced).

Thank you for your time and specially for the fantastic software you build.
