Dear Disqus Team

UI Engineer position.

Today, when reviewing the new “Update to Disqus Privacy Policy”, out of curiosity I checked the jobs you have listed and the UI Engineer caught my eye. As I read the description I got the impression that it summed up the parts that I most like about my job, and would love to do it for years, specially in a growing company that has to keep up to date. 

So I've spent the rest of the day updating a bit my stagnant CV.

I strongly believe that I can bring a set of skills, creativity, enthusiasm, commitment and experience to your team. I am Designer by academic training and a self taught developer. I have 10 years of working experience in a variety of front-end languages and technologies, particularly good at HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

I am a self driven professional who has been at the service of multiple clients for the last eight years, some for several years. I deeply enjoy complex problems and even more as part of a team with whom to work on them. I am keen on understanding deeply each technology I have to work with.

You may find much more details about me and examples of my work on my on-line CV at http://iminabar.com (That's how my last name is pronounced).

I would love to be part of a company that has consistently been deploying a solid, creative and beautiful service for the web. Setting the example and the benchmark for the world's commenting systems. I use Disqus on my blog and would never go back.

Thank you for your time and specially for the fantastic software you build.

Hoping to hear from you

Best regards

h3. Nescappuccino Game (Nestle) 

h4(the-year). (2011)

Assembled and directed a team to develop a Game for the sales forces of Nestlé Pro, in Chile. Wrote the script, design, art direction, project direction and lead development of the game, also some illustration.

Here I learned the immense amount of work involved in game development, and learned about many runtime optimization techniques and testing techniques.
