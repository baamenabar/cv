## Dearest projects

All of the work in [medula.cl](http://medula.cl) has been done under my lead; most, directly by me. I
have created several long relationships with customers and organizations which enable constant iteration of
projects even on tight budgets. Some of the most notable are:

### Printable cards web app

#### (2020) {#section .the-year}

[https://cards.medula.cl/](https://cards.medula.cl/)

Simple VueJS application with a serverless Google Cloud backend.

Simple app I wrote for creating and storing printable "handouts" for the DnD campaign I play with my kids. Took the chance to play with VueJS and some Google Cloud serverless products. Repo: [https://github.com/baamenabar/printable-handout-cards](https://github.com/baamenabar/printable-handout-cards)

### Flyimg: Image transformations microservice

#### (2017) {#section-3 .the-year}

[https://github.com/flyimg/flyimg](https://github.com/flyimg/flyimg/)

Dockerized PHP7 application runs as a Microservice to resize and crop images on the fly. Get optimised images
with MozJPEG, WebP or PNG using ImageMagick.

Performance and image compression have been my pet peeves for years, this year I joined a friend to develop this
microservice that generates images ready to be used in responsive projects.

I wrote the resizing and cropping algorithms, most of the documentation and the nginx config.

### Westwing Redesign

#### (2015) {#section-1 .the-year}

[www.westwing.de](https://www.westwing.de/), [www.westwingnow.de](https://www.westwingnow.de/)

Coded most of the redesign of the two most visited pages at Westwing.de.

Recently coded most of the redesign and refactor of the whole product grid in it's multiple incarnations.

Monitoring and pushing the frontend performance of the Westwing website, looking to get the highest impact with
the lowest effort possible.

### _La GuÃ­a Silvestre_ / The Sylvan Guide : biodiversity and wild areas app.

#### (2014) {#section-2 .the-year}

[huilmo.org](https://baamenabar.github.io/sitio-guia-silvestre/)

My baby, a project in the making. A compiler of biodiversity guides, each aimed at specific locations, with
geolocation and local storage of information. It currently can load, process and import Missions from [Project
Noah](http://www.projectnoah.org/) and compile them in a Ionic web-app.

Initially started with Sencha Touch 2, but switched to Ionic + AngularJS + NodeJS and fell in love with them.

I applied the project for seed funding, but on september 2014 got rejected for not having enough potential
profit.

Note: the huilmo.org website was hacked together from a lousy template in one night, not my code.

The repo can be found at: <https://github.com/baamenabar/vas>
