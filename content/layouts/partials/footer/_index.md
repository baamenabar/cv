[This site has it’s own repository on Github](https://github.com/baamenabar/cv), built using
Hugo written with Markdown.

This online CV has been also designed to be printed or saved as a PDF in A4 format with the proper page-breaks. If you are reading this printed or on a PDF, you can visit the original, more complete (and maybe updated) CV on [iminabar.com](http://iminabar.com/)

Thanks for reading so far.
