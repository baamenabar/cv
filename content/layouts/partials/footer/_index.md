## Colophon

[This site has it’s own repository on Github](https://github.com/baamenabar/cv), built using
Hugo written with Markdown.

This HTML CV has also been designed to be printed or saved as a PDF with the proper page-breaks. It will maintain most of it’s layout. If your are reading this on a <span class="caps">PDF</span> or printed you can visit the original, more complete (and maybe updated) CV on [iminabar.com](http://iminabar.com/)

Thanks for reading so far.  
Agustín
