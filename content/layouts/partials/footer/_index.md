## Colophon

[This site has it’s own repository on Github](https://github.com/baamenabar/cv), built using
Hugo written with Markdown.

This <span class="caps">HTML</span> CV has also been designed to be printed or saved as a <span class="caps">PDF</span>
with the proper page-breaks. It will maintain most of it’s layout. If your are reading this on a <span class="caps">PDF</span>
you can visit the original (and maybe updated) CV on [iminabar.com](http://iminabar.com/)

Thanks for reading so far.  
Agustín
